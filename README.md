uDMX-linux
==========

This is a small command-line utility to drive the www.anyma.ch/uDMX interface.
It allows to set DMX values manually from the commandline. Fixtures and
values can be predefined with aliases in a rc file.

The initial source code comes originally from http://udmx.googlecode.com/.
This repository was moved to Github since: https://github.com/mirdej/udmx/.
It the original code compiled with minimal tweaks, but the result core-dumped.

This is a cleaned-up and improved version, with alias support built in.

You need a uDMX interface to use it, of course.
